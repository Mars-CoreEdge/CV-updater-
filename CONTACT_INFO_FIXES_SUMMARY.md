# Contact Info Handling Fixes - Complete Solution

## 🎯 Problem Summary

The user was experiencing two main issues with contact info handling in the CV template:

1. **Contact Info Placement Issue**: When contact info already existed, the code was mistakenly moving it to the bottom of the page instead of keeping it in its original position.

2. **Variable Scope Error**: The code was trying to access the `sections` variable before it was defined, causing a "cannot access local variable" error.

## 🔧 Root Cause Analysis

### Issue 1: Contact Info Placement
- The `smart_section_integration` function had `'contact'` at the very end of the `cv_order` array
- This caused new contact sections to be placed at the bottom of the CV
- The logic didn't properly check if contact info already existed before creating new sections

### Issue 2: Variable Scope Error
- In `_generate_cv_with_projects_internal` function, the `sections` variable was being accessed on line 3463 before being defined on line 3472
- This caused a runtime error: `cannot access local variable 'sections' where it is not associated with a value`

### Issue 3: Unicode Character Error
- In `generate_enhanced_pdf` function, there was a reference to `unicode_char` which was not defined
- This caused a `name 'unicode_char' is not defined` error

## ✅ Solutions Implemented

### 1. Fixed Variable Scope Error

**File**: `backend/main_enhanced.py` (lines 3462-3472)

**Before**:
```python
# If no manually added projects, remove any existing projects section and return original CV
if not new_projects:
    # Clean up any existing projects section
    if 'projects' in sections:  # ❌ sections not defined yet
        # Remove the projects section entirely
        start_line = sections['projects']['start_line']
        end_line = sections['projects']['end_line']
        del cv_lines[start_line:end_line + 1]
        return '\n'.join(cv_lines)
    return original_cv

# Parse CV sections
sections = parse_cv_sections(original_cv)  # ❌ defined too late
cv_lines = original_cv.split('\n')
```

**After**:
```python
# Parse CV sections first
sections = parse_cv_sections(original_cv)  # ✅ defined first
cv_lines = original_cv.split('\n')

# If no manually added projects, remove any existing projects section and return original CV
if not new_projects:
    # Clean up any existing projects section
    if 'projects' in sections:  # ✅ sections now defined
        # Remove the projects section entirely
        start_line = sections['projects']['start_line']
        end_line = sections['projects']['end_line']
        del cv_lines[start_line:end_line + 1]
        return '\n'.join(cv_lines)
    return original_cv
```

### 2. Fixed Contact Info Placement Logic

**File**: `backend/main_enhanced.py` (lines 3334-3420)

**Enhanced `smart_section_integration` function**:

```python
# Special handling for contact info - also check if contact info exists in the content
if section_type == 'contact' and not target_section:
    # Check if contact info already exists in the CV content
    cv_content_lower = cv_content.lower()
    contact_indicators = ['@', 'phone:', 'email:', 'linkedin.com', 'github.com', 'gmail.com', 'outlook.com', 'yahoo.com']
    if any(indicator in cv_content_lower for indicator in contact_indicators):
        print(f"📝 Contact info already exists in CV content, skipping creation")
        return cv_content

# Contact info should be near the top, after name but before other sections
if section_type == 'contact':
    # For contact info, insert after the first few lines (name and any existing contact info)
    insert_pos = 0
    for i, line in enumerate(cv_lines[:10]):  # Check first 10 lines
        line_stripped = line.strip()
        # If we find a section header or if we've passed the name/contact area
        if (line_stripped and 
            (line_stripped.isupper() and len(line_stripped) > 3) or
            any(keyword in line_stripped.upper() for keyword in ['EDUCATION', 'EXPERIENCE', 'SKILLS', 'OBJECTIVE'])):
            insert_pos = i
            break
        # If we find existing contact info, don't add more
        if any(contact_indicator in line_stripped.lower() for contact_indicator in ['@', 'phone:', 'email:', 'linkedin.com', 'github.com']):
            # Contact info already exists, don't create new section
            print(f"📝 Contact info already exists, skipping creation")
            return cv_content
    # If we didn't find a section header, insert after first few lines
    if insert_pos == 0:
        insert_pos = min(5, len(cv_lines))
```

### 3. Enhanced `insert_content_in_section_enhanced` Function

**File**: `backend/main_enhanced.py` (lines 296-355)

**Added special contact info handling**:

```python
# Special handling for contact info
if section_name.lower() == 'contact':
    # Check if contact info already exists in the CV content
    cv_content_lower = cv_content.lower()
    contact_indicators = ['@', 'phone:', 'email:', 'linkedin.com', 'github.com', 'gmail.com', 'outlook.com', 'yahoo.com']
    if any(indicator in cv_content_lower for indicator in contact_indicators):
        print(f"📝 Contact info already exists in CV content, skipping creation")
        return cv_content
    
    # For contact info, insert after the first few lines (name and any existing contact info)
    insert_position = 0
    for i, line in enumerate(lines[:10]):  # Check first 10 lines
        line_stripped = line.strip()
        # If we find a section header or if we've passed the name/contact area
        if (line_stripped and 
            (line_stripped.isupper() and len(line_stripped) > 3) or
            any(keyword in line_stripped.upper() for keyword in ['EDUCATION', 'EXPERIENCE', 'SKILLS', 'OBJECTIVE'])):
            insert_position = i
            break
    # If we didn't find a section header, insert after first few lines
    if insert_position == 0:
        insert_position = min(5, len(lines))
```

### 4. Fixed Unicode Character Error

**File**: `backend/main_enhanced.py` (line 380)

**Before**:
```python
for uni, ascii_char in replacements.items():
    cv_content = cv_content.replace(unicode_char, ascii_char)  # ❌ unicode_char not defined
```

**After**:
```python
for uni, ascii_char in replacements.items():
    cv_content = cv_content.replace(uni, ascii_char)  # ✅ using uni variable
```

## 🧪 Test Results

Created and ran `test_contact_info_fix.py` with comprehensive testing:

| Test Case | Status | Result |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Server Connection | ✅ PASS | Server is running and responding |
| CV Content Retrieval | ✅ PASS | Successfully retrieved CV content |
| Contact Info Detection | ✅ PASS | Correctly detected existing contact info |
| Contact Info Addition | ✅ PASS | Added new contact info when needed |
| Contact Info Positioning | ✅ PASS | Contact info positioned correctly (near top) |
| Duplicate Prevention | ✅ PASS | Prevents duplicate contact sections |

**Overall Result**: All tests passed successfully

## 📋 What This Fixes

1. **Variable Scope Errors**: Eliminates the "cannot access local variable 'sections'" error
2. **Contact Info Placement**: Ensures contact info stays in its original position and doesn't get moved to the bottom
3. **Duplicate Prevention**: Prevents creation of duplicate contact info sections
4. **Unicode Handling**: Fixes PDF generation errors related to Unicode characters
5. **Smart Positioning**: Contact info is now placed near the top of the CV, after the name but before other sections

## 🎯 Expected Behavior

- **If contact info exists**: Do not move or re-append it
- **If contact info doesn't exist**: Create it and insert it in the correct position (near the top, not at the bottom)
- **No variable scope errors**: All variables are properly defined before use
- **No Unicode errors**: PDF generation works correctly with special characters

## 🔄 Backward Compatibility

All changes are backward compatible and don't affect existing functionality. The fixes only improve the handling of contact info and resolve the variable scope issues.
