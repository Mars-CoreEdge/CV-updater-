## üéØ Project Extraction Logic

### Section Detection
The system looks for various project section headers:
- `PROJECTS`
- `PORTFOLIO`
- `PROJECT EXPERIENCE`
- `KEY PROJECTS`
- `SELECTED PROJECTS`

### Project Parsing
1. **Title Detection**: Identifies project titles based on capitalization and content
2. **Duration Extraction**: Finds date patterns like `[2023 - Present]`
3. **Technology Detection**: Extracts from "Technologies:" lines or keyword matching
4. **Highlights Parsing**: Converts bullet points into achievement lists

### Technology Recognition
Automatically detects common technologies:
- Frontend: React, Vue.js, Angular, JavaScript, TypeScript
- Backend: Node.js, Express, Django, Spring, Python
- Databases: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, MySQL, Redis
- Cloud: AWS, Docker, Kubernetes
- APIs: REST, GraphQL, Socket.io
